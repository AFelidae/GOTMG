#GOTMG
This was largely inspired by a online flash game "realm of the mad god"
I wanted to recreate it from the first person perspective and in a 3d space

###Controls
```
W = Walk Forward
S = Walk Backward
A = Walk Left
D = Walk Right
J = Turn Left
L = Turn Right
```

###Level Editor
There is a default level that I used for testing the collision system
But if you want to go further you can make your own level with the level editor
https://github.com/AnotherEntity/GOTMG-LevelEditor
If you want to play your own can export it to json and set the `myLevel` variable in game.js

###Future Plans
* ~~player movement~~
* ~~world loader~~
* ~~level editor~~
* ~~collisions~~
* projectiles
* hit detection for projectiles
* sprites
* ai for sprites (enemies)
* revamp level editor
* day night cycle
* projectile patterns
